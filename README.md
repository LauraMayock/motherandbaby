# **_Westport's Mother and Baby group - Project Portfolio 1 - HTML & CSS_**
They say it takes a village to raise a child, well this website aims to allow new parents to reach out to their community and build that support system. Not only will it outline Westport's Mother and baby group meetups and schedules, but also have a section for other events organised by the mother and baby grounp and within the greater Westport community.

You can view the live site here - ,a href="https://lauramayock.github.io/motherandbaby/" target="_blank"> Westport Mother and baby. </a>

# Objective

The aim is to create a user-friendly website that provides helpful information to a specific user/audience. The reader has easy access to evident and relayed information on the topic of interest.

# User Experience: (UX)

## Target Audience
* Parents, Guardians and carers of babies and pre-school children looking to connect with others are their local community.
* Parents, Guardians and carers of children are looking for information on upcoming events geared towards families.

## First time user:
As a first time visitor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the page and to navigate to the areas most important to me. I will be hoping to see local meet up schedules and a way to contact organisers if I have any other queries. It will be a pleasant surprise to have additional local resource information and the option to be added to a Whats app group.

## Return user:
As a returning user, I will be taking advantage of the events page for my little ones, e.g. mother and baby yoga classes, baby massage and upcoming family events, and pre-book my place.

## Site Aims
 * To provide the user with all the information on the weekly meetups. 
 * To offer information on upcomming events geared young familys both within the Mother and baby group and within the grater Westport community. 
 * To create a welcoming and intuite website that provide a great online presence
  of the Mother and baby group. I also hope to try and make the users feel welcome with the imagery and tones used in the design as well as the testimonial section. I also aimed to give them as much value as HTML and CSS would allow with the added welcome of local events not linked to the mother and baby group pre-booking form and the ability to be added to a messaging group. Other features may be added in the future, such as direct booking for future events, a blog, a list of local community resources and a live chat area where moms can get to know each other on the site. 

## Design Wireframes
The innitial goals and scope of the website were worked on and planned using figma. The sturctue and scope of the website differs from the initial planning as i deemed it important to initially approach the project considering all possible feature that would be benificial for both the customer and the user. This provide a good basis for a minimum viable product as well as future add ons.

## Site Stucture

The website has four pages, with three accessible by the navigation bar at the top of the page. The Navigation bar consists of a Home tab(index.html), an Events tab(events.html) and a contact us tab(contact-us.html). The logo on the left-hand side of the navigation bar is also a link to the home page. The fourth page is accessible using the two form links on the events page. These bring you to a pre-booking from(pre-booking-form.html)  

## Design Choices

I tried to keep the design simple and keep the users in mind, giving them as much value as possible within the remit given. I think this approach will make the user feel already part of the community and hopefully alleviate any anxiety they may think about reaching out.

### Imagery

I found inspiration for my landing page from a fellow student's recent project submission.[Slack user name @Ivaylo Ivanov](https://daooobg.github.io/yogaClubProject) I loved the movement used in her hero element and looked to recreate it myself. I spent a great deal of time choosing the right hero image as I feel it sets the tone of the page and connects with the user.

I have outlined some of my considerations in choosing the correct hero element below:

* A video which is in tune with Mother and baby groups ethos.
* Something engaging but not distracting.
* No sharp, sudden movements.
* No apparent end and beginning.
* Something that works well on most if not all screen sizes.
 
 After much searching consideration, I was happy to preseed with the below choice as I feel it ticked all the boxes.

The rest of the images on the website were purposely chosen to have the same natural tones as the hero image.
 
### Logo

After choosing the hero image, I then decided to design the Logo. Using the website Looka.com I tried to create something simple and elegant. 

[Origional logo design](assets/images/Mother%20and%20baby%20Logo.png)

Although I was initially thrilled with my design, I soon realised that the shape caused it to intrude into the hero image or create too much white space if placed on the navigation bar. In the end, I decided to simplify it and go with the logo presently used on sight.

### Colour scheme

My final choice of colours was chosen to fit in with the logo. A selection of Teal Green, and white. As the green was an intense colour, I knew they were a great choice of colour for contrasting, ensuring the eligibility of text and sticking with the theme of simplicity.

### Typography

I chose two fonts from the google font gallery. Comfortaa for the main text and Patua One for the information in the footer. I did try a few options to highlight the quote below the hero video but decided against it as it was too jarring. I chose Arial as the font family to fall back on for Comfortaa as it would still fit in with the feel of the page. And the font Georgia as a fallback for Patua One.

#Features

## Navigation

* The navigation menu is positioned at the top of each page and gives the user easy access to the main areas of the website.
* The logo, which is also prominent on each page, gives an easy link back to the main page.
* The navigational link to the Pre-booking form is purposely placed within the advertisements, which are solely related to the event organised by the mother and baby group.
* This is to ensure minimum confusion for the user of the site.
* To ensure eligibility and easy use, the navigation bar converts from a row of navigation buttons at the top of the page to a row nestled beneath the logo on smaller screens.

![Large screen](assets/images/Nav-bar%20large%20screen.png)
![Small screen](assets/images/Nav-bar%20small%20screen.png)

* Each navigation link has a hover element as a visual add for the user. 

## Home Page

* As it is the landing page, it needed to appeal to the eye and striking. I wanted it to be memorable and unique but in keeping with the tone of the page. As the users lifesytles are busy, it is vital that the user immediately know they are on the correct website at a glance.
* For the larger screens, the hero video is falling a bit below the screen; this intuitively nudges the user to scroll down. On the smaller screens, you can see the opening heading which, as well as the hero video, is purposely chosen to connect with the user.

![Landing page medium screen](assets/images/hero-image-medium-screen.png)
![Landing page small screen](assets/images/hero-image-small-screen.png)

* The main text area gives a quick overview of what to expect at each meeting. It provides critical information to alleviate user concerns by pointing out who the group facilitates and the amenities available to them and their child. 

* The Weekly meet up section gives a day, time and google link to the location of each of the meetups. Again the simple prominent design was purposely done for a user on the go. 

* The Testimonials section is also a key element in encouraging anxious new parents that the Westport mother and baby group is perfect for them. It helps lay the foundation of trust and kinship with the user by providing testimonials from users to relate to.

* Each element on this page has the first time user, the new parent eager to connect with their local community, and the returning user looking to find the information required quickly.

<h3>Main hero element.
<p>I tested my idea of using a video for my hero element by creating a mock-up in Gitpod. As it was one of the main focuses of the landing page I wanted it to not distract from the other important elements on the page. 
I will also:
<ul>
<li>Ask for advice and guidance from my mentor.
<li>Post on a Slack peer review channel to get feedback from a broader user base.

<P>My original positioning of the hero video meant that you needed to scroll down to see the image in full. I corrected this by placing the scroll bar on top of the image.
