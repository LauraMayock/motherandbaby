<h1>Westport's Mother and Baby group.</h1>
<P>They say it takes a village to raise a child, well this website aims to allow new parents to reach out to their community and build that support system. Not only will it outline Westport's Mother and baby group meetups and schedules, but also have a section for other events in Westport that may be of benefit and links to government/healthcare resources to support their family in the early years. </P>

<h2>User experience:</h2>

<h3> First time user:</h3>
<p>As a first time visitor I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the page and to be able to navigate to the areas most important to me. I will be hoping to see local meet up schedules and a way to contact organisers if I have any other queries. It will be a nice surprise to have other local resource information and the option to be added to a Whats app group.</p>

<P>I have tried to make the website intuitive by keeping the design simple and easy to navigate. I aim to try and make the users feel welcome with the imagery and tones that were chosen. I also aimed to give them as much value as HTML and CSS would allow with the added welcome of local resource links and local events not linked to the mother and baby group. In the future, other features may be added such as direct booking for future events, a blog, and a live chat area where moms can get to know each other on the site. 

<P>It will also be reassuring to see all the testimonials from other local moms who are currently for have been members of the group.

<h3>Return user:
<P>As a returning user, I will be taking advantage of the community resource links, such as a list of local doctors, contact information for the district nurse and speech and language therapists in the area, these are to name a few.
I will also be able to keep up to date with local events for my little one e.g. little duckling swimming lessons in the local swimming pool, mother and baby yoga classes and family fun events.

<h2>Design<h2>

<p>I tried to keep the design simple and but also keep the users in mind give them as much value as possible within the remit given. I think this approach will make the user feel already part of the community and hopefully alleviate any anxiety they may feel about reaching out.

<h3>Colour scheme

<P>I spent time choosing the right hero image as I feel it sets the tone of the page and connects with the user. The colour choice was then taken from this image to give the website a uniform and professional feel. 
/*Two main colours and how I incorporated them throughout. */
