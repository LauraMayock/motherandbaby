<h1>Westport's Mother and Baby group.</h1>
<P>They say it takes a village to raise a child, well this website aims to allow new parents to reach out to their community and build that support system. Not only will it outline Westport's Mother and baby group meetups and schedules, but also have a section for other events in Westport that may be of benefit and links to government/healthcare resources to support their family in the early years. </P>
